It also originally was available for US$769, US$869, or US$969 unlocked and contract-free for either AT&T or T-Mobile.\n\nIt additionally originally was available on an \"iPhone Upgrade Program\" lease for US$37.41, US$41.58, or US$45.75 per month, respectively. This lease required the device to be traded in at the end of one year toward a newer model. Finally, it originally was available via \"Apple iPhone Installments\" without an annual upgrade for US$32.04, US$36.20, or US$40.37 per month. These monthly pricing options did not include the cost of mobile or data service. Note that the \"jet black\" and (PRODUCT) RED color options only originally were available in 128 GB or 256 GB capacities, although on September 12, 2017, Apple introduced a 32 GB variant of jet black and discontinued (PRODUCT) RED altogether.\n\n**On September 12, 2017, Apple discontinued the 256 GB options and lowered the price of the 32 GB and 128 GB options. Unlocked and contract-free, these models became US$669 and US$769.
